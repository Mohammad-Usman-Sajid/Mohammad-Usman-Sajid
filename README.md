Software engineer building production systems with a focus on **correctness**, **scalability**, and **long-term maintainability**. Most work centers on **business-critical financial systems**, **integrations**, and **automation**, where failure is not an option.

I spend most of my time designing and maintaining systems that must remain stable across platform upgrades, evolving business requirements, and long operational lifecycles.

        •	RESTful APIs, authentication flows, and background processing
        •	Database design, transactional consistency, and data validation
        •	Performance-aware handling of large datasets and long-running operations

    Client and Frontend Applications:
        •	React-based web applications
        •	Android and Android TV applications (Java, Kotlin)

**Typical Work**

    •	Designing Business Central extension architectures that survive multiple major upgrades
    •	Implementing robust integrations between ERP systems and external platforms
    •	Building configuration-driven systems to reduce operational friction
    •	Refactoring legacy logic into maintainable, testable components
    •	Supporting and evolving production systems used in day-to-day financial operations

**Engineering Approach**

    •	Strong separation of business logic, infrastructure, and presentation layers
    •	API-first design with explicit contracts and clear ownership
    •	Defensive programming and validation in financial and enterprise workflows
    •	Emphasis on observability, correctness, and predictable behavior
    •	Ownership of systems from initial design through production support
